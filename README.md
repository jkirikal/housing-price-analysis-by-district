## Motivation:
The motivation for this project was our curiosity about how the housing market has moved through the years and what districts are cheaper and more expensive. While exploring the data we also wanted to create a model to predict this data.  
## Goal:
The goal of our project is to visualize the change in house prices by the districts in Tallinn and Tartu. Also to create a model that could predict the housing market with some accuracy.
