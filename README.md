# Housing pricing and trends analysis by district  
### Team members:
- Daglas Aitsen
- Johan Kirikal  
- Mihkel Jaas Karu



## Guide:
code - We have provided different notebooks that you can access and run
- scraper.py is the scraper we created to get the data on house price sales by district
- LSTM_model.ipynb is the model we created to predict the market
- housing_price_analysis_by_district.ipynb is where all the analysis, graphs and pictures are created
   
data - All the data we used in the project
- /geospatial - all the geospatial maps we used are under there (tallinna_asumid, tartu_asumid)
- /inflation - all the data we have on the inflation in estonia
- price_data.csv - the data we scaped off the web, average prices by month and district
  
results - the results we got in the form of graphs, geospatial heatmaps and so on
- /gif - animated heatmaps that show Tartu and Tallinn house prices by district
- tlnprices.PNG - graph showing the average prices of houses by district from 2007-2023
## Motivation:
The motivation for this project was our curiosity about how the housing market has moved through the years and what districts are cheaper and more expensive. While exploring the data we also wanted to create a model to predict this data.  
## Goal:
The goal of our project is to visualize the change in house prices by the districts in Tallinn and Tartu. Also to create a model that could predict the housing market with some accuracy.
